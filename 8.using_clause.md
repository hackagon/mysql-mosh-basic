# USING CLAUSE

If several columns have the same names but the datatypes do not match, the NATURAL JOIN clause can be modified with the USING clause to specify the columns that should be used for an EQUIJOIN.

- USING Clause is used to match only one column when more than one column matches.
- NATURAL JOIN and USING Clause are mutually exclusive.
- It should not have a qualifier(table name or Alias) in the referenced columns.
- NATURAL JOIN uses all the columns with matching names and datatypes to join the tables. The USING Clause can be used to specify only those columns that should be used for an EQUIJOIN.

# Example 1:
```
use sql_store;

select 
    o.order_id,
    c.first_name,
    sh.name
from orders o 
join customers c 
    using (customer_id)
left join shippers sh 
    using (shipper_id);
```

# Example 2:
```
use sql_store;

select *
from order_items oi
left join order_item_notes oin
    using (order_id, product_id);
```
# Exercise
```
use sql_invoicing;

select
    p.date,
    c.name as client,
    p.amount,
    pm.name as payment_method
from payments p
join clients c using (client_id)
join payment_methods pm
    on p.payment_method = pm.payment_method_id
```
