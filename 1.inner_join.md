# INNER JOIN

- The INNER JOIN keyword selects all rows from both tables **as long as there is a match** between the columns. 
- If there are records in the `Orders` table that do not have matches in `Customers`, these orders will not be shown!

Example 1: in `sql_store` table
```
select order_id, c.customer_id, first_name, last_name
from orders o
join customers c
    on o.customer_id = c.customer_id;
```

Example 2: in `sql_store` table

```
select order_id, c.customer_id, first_name, last_name
from customers c
join orders o
    on o.customer_id = c.customer_id;
```

Exercise:
Join `order_items` and `products` table in `sql_store` database

```
select oi.order_id, oi.product_id, quantity, p.unit_price
from order_items oi
join products p 
    on oi.product_id = p.product_id;
```
