# OUT JOIN

Look at the result of the inner join query:
```
select
    c.customer_id,
    c.first_name,
    o.order_id
from customers c
join orders o 
    on c.customer_id = o.customer_id
order by c.customer_id;
```
Customers who do not have order(s) not displayed in the result;

### LEFT JOIN
```
use sql_store;

select
    c.customer_id,
    c.first_name,
    o.order_id
from customers c
left join orders o 
    on c.customer_id = o.customer_id
order by c.customer_id;
```

### RIGHT JOIN
```
use sql_store;

select
    c.customer_id,
    c.first_name,
    o.order_id
from customers c
right join orders o 
    on c.customer_id = o.customer_id
order by c.customer_id;
```

```
use sql_store;

select
    p.product_id,
    p.name,
